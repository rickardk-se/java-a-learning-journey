### Object-Oriented Programming

#### Encapsulation
Encapsulation is a programming mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates. It keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse.

Java's basic unit of encapsulation is the class. A class defines the structure and behavior of an object. An object is an instance of a class.

Within an object, the data may be public or private. Public data can be accessed by any other object. Private data can only be accessed by methods that are members of the same object.

The code and data that constitue a class are known as members of the class. The data members of a class are known as instance variables. The code that operates on the instance variables is known as methods.

#### Polymorphism

Polymorphism is often expressed as "one interface, many methods." It is a programming technique that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.

#### Inheritance
Inheritance is a mechanism by which one class acquires the properties and behavior of another class. The class that is inherited from is called the superclass. The class that inherits is called the subclass. A real-world example of inheritance is a car. A car is a vehicle. A car inherits the properties and behavior of a vehicle.

Inheritance is important because it allows code to be reused. It also allows new classes to be created that are based on existing classes.

#### The Java-Development Kit (JDK)
First you need to install the JDK. The JDK is a software development kit that contains the tools needed to develop Java applications. The JDK includes the Java compiler, the Java runtime environment, and the Java API.

Oracle provides the JDK for free. You can download the JDK from the Oracle website.

OpenJDK is an open-source implementation of the JDK. It is maintained by the OpenJDK community.

The difference between Oracle JDK and OpenJDK is that Oracle JDK is a commercial product that is free for personal use, while OpenJDK is free for everyone. The technical differences between the two are minimal.

The JDK supplies two primary programs. The first is the Java compiler, **javac**, which is used to compile Java source code into byte code. The second is the Java interpreter, **java**, which is used to execute Java byte code.

A first example program can be found in the folder `../src/java_a_beginners_guide/ch01/Example.java`.

To compile the program, you need to use the `javac` command followed by the name of the source code file. For example, `javac Example.java`.

The java compiler requires that the source code file be named with the `.java` extension. The compiler creates a file with the `.class` extension. This file contains the byte code version of the program.

The name of the class must match the name of the file. The class name is case-sensitive.

To run the program, you need to use the `java` command followed by the name of the class. For example, `java Example`.


A multi-line comment is started with `/*` and ended with `*/`. A single-line comment is started with `//`.

A javado comment is started with `/**` and ended with `*/`. It is used to create documentation for the program.

The keyword `class` is used to declare a class.

The main method is the entry point of a Java program. It is declared as `public static void main(String[] args)`. The main method is called when the program is executed.

A good way to remember the main method signature is to think of its acronym: `psvm`. It stands for `public static void main`.

The `public` keyword is an access specifier. It means that the main method can be called by any other object.

The opposite of `public` is `private`. A `private` method can only be called by other methods in the same class.

The keyword `void` is a return type. It means that the main method does not return a value.

`String[] args` is an array of strings that are passed to the main method. The main method can accept command-line arguments.

The curly braces `{}` are used to define the scope of the main method.

`System.out.println()` is a method that is used to print a line of text to the console.

Notice that statements in Java end with a semicolon `;`.

A variable is a named memory location that is used to store data. A variable must be declared before it can be used. The declaration of a variable specifies its type and name.

To declare a variable, you need to specify the type of the variable followed by the name of the variable. For example, `int money;`.

The `int` keyword is used to declare an integer variable. An integer is a whole number.

To assign a value to a variable, you need to use the assignment operator `=`. For example, `money = 100;`.

It is possible to declare and assign a value to a variable in the same statement. For example, `int money = 100;`.

It is also possible to declare and assign variables of the same type in the same statement. For example, `int money = 100, balance = 200;`.

A second example program can be found in the folder `../src/java_a_beginners_guide/ch01/Example2.java`.

To allow fractional values, Java defines two floating-point types: `float` and `double`. The `float` type is a single-precision floating-point number. The `double` type is a double-precision floating-point number.

A third example program can be found in the folder `../src/java_a_beginners_guide/ch01/Example3.java`.
