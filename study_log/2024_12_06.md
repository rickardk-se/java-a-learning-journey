## Java: A Beginner's Guide - Chapter 1

### Introduction

Java was created in 1991 and was orignally named Oak. It was renamed to Java in 1995. Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible..

The two languages that forms Java's foundation are C and C++.

Both Java and C# are similar in many ways. They are both object-oriented, class-based, and have similar syntax. However, Java is platform-independent, while C# is not.

Java is a platform-independent language. This means that Java programs can run on any operating system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. Java's magic, the byte code, is the key to its platform independence. The byte code is the intermediate representation of the source code that is generated by the Java compiler. The byte code is then interpreted by the JVM.

Java bytecode can be compiled into machine code by a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler. The JIT compiler is a part of the JVM that compiles the byte code into machine code that can be executed by the CPU. The JIT compiler is used to improve the performance of Java programs.

The jlink tool can be used to create a custom runtime image that contains only the modules that are required by the application. This can reduce the size of the runtime image and improve the performance of the application.

The jpackage tool can be used to package the application and its dependencies into a platform-specific installer that can be distributed to users. The jpackage tool can create installers for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Major releases of Java are released every six months. LTS (Long-Term Support) releases are released every three years. The latest LTS release is Java 21 which was release in September 2023.

Each major release, now called feature releases, introduces new features and enhancements to the Java platform.

### The Java Buzzwords
- Simple - Java is designed to be easy to learn and use.
- Secure - Java is designed to be secure and to protect the user from malicious code.
- Portable - Java is designed to be platform-independent and to run on any operating system that has a JVM installed.
- Object-oriented - Java is designed to be object-oriented and to support the creation of reusable code.
- Robust - Java is designed to be robust and to handle errors gracefully.
- Multithreaded - Java is designed to support multithreading and to allow multiple threads to run concurrently.
- Architecture-neutral - Java is designed to be architecture-neutral and to run on any architecture that has a JVM installed.
- Interpreted - Java supports cross-platform code execution through the use of byte code.
- High performance - Java is designed to be high performance and to execute code quickly.
- Distributed - Java is designed to support distributed computing and to allow objects to communicate over a network.
- Dynamic - Java is designed to be dynamic and to support dynamic loading of classes and interfaces.
