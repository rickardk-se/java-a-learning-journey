## Java: A Beginner's Guide - Chapter 2

### Data Types

Java is a strongly typed language. This means that every variable must have a declared type. Java has two categories of data types:
- Primitive data types
- Reference data types

#### Primitive Data Types
Java has eight primitive data types:
| Type | Description | Size | Range | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `byte` | 8-bit signed integer | 8 bits | -128 to 127 | `byte b = 10;` |
| `short` | 16-bit signed integer | 16 bits | -32,768 to 32,767 | `short s = 1000;` |
| `int` | 32-bit signed integer | 32 bits | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 | `int i = 100000;` |
| `long` | 64-bit signed integer | 64 bits | -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 | `long l = 100000L;` |
| `float` | 32-bit floating-point | 32 bits | | `float f = 230.47f;` |
| `double` | 64-bit floating-point | 64 bits | | `double d = 230.47;` |
| `char` | 16-bit Unicode character | 16 bits | 0 to 65,535 | `char c = 'A';` |

#### Examples

char
```java
jshell> char letter = 'R';
letter ==> 'R'

jshell> ++letter
$7 ==> 'S'

jshell> char c
c ==> '\000' // default value is '\000'

jshell> char number = 90; // A char can also be assigned an integer value
number ==> 'Z'
```

boolean
```java
jshell> boolean b;
b ==> false  // default value is false

jshell> b = true;
b ==> true
```

float
```java
jshell> float f;
f ==> 0.0

jshell> f = 1.337f
f ==> 1.337
```

long
```java
jshell> long l
l ==> 0

jshell> l = 10L
l ==> 10
```

double
```double
jshell> double d
d ==> 0.0

jshell> d = 1.337
d ==> 1.337
```


Local variables must be initialized before they are used. Java does not automatically initialize local variables to a default value as shown above. Java only initializes fields and class variables to default values.

```java
public class BoolDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean f;

        f = false; // local variable must be initialized before use
        System.out.println("f is " + f);

        f = true;
        if (f) // no need for "(f == true)"
            System.out.println("f is now " + f);
    }

}
```

### Literals
A *literal* is a constant value that appears directly in the code. For example, `10` is an integer literal, and `3.14159` is a floating-point literal.

All primitive data types have literals.

#### Character Escape Sequences

| Escape Sequence | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `\'` | Single quote |
| `\"` | Double quote |
| `\\` | Backslash |
| `\n` | Newline |
| `\r` | Carriage return |
| `\t` | Tab |
| `\b` | Backspace |
| `\f` | Formfeed |
| `\ddd` | Octal character (ddd) |
| `\uxxxx` | Unicode character (xxxx) |
| `\s` | Space |
| `\endofline` | Line continuation (text block) |

#### String Literals
A string literal is a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes. For example, `"Hello, World!"`. A string is not a primitive data type. It is a reference data type. A single character string is not a `char` but a `String`. Notice the use of double quotes instead of single quotes.

### Variables

To initialize a variable, you must declare it and assign it a value. For example, `int x = 100;`.

Variables can also be initialized dynamically. For example, `int x = 10, y = 20, z = x + y;`.

### Scope
A block of code is a set of statements enclosed in curly braces `{}`. A variable declared inside a block is only accessible within that block. This is known as the variable's scope.

A method and its parameters are also a block of code. The parameters are only accessible within the method.

```java
package java_a_beginners_guide.ch02;

public class ScopeDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x; // known to all code within main
        x = 10;
        if (x == 10) { // start new scope
            int y = 20; // known only to this block

            // x and y both known here

            System.out.println("x and y: " + x + " " + y);

            x = y * 2;
        }

        // y = 100; // Error! y not known here

        System.out.println("x is: " + x);

    }
}
```

### Operators

#### Arithmetic Operators
| Operator | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `+` | Addition | `a + b` |
| `-` | Subtraction | `a - b` |
| `*` | Multiplication | `a * b` |
| `/` | Division | `a / b` |
| `%` | Modulus | `a % b` |
| `++` | Increment | `a++` |
| `--` | Decrement | `a--` |


When doing integer division, the result is an integer. For example, `5 / 2` is `2`. The remainder is discarded.

The increment and decrement operators can be used as prefix or postfix operators. For example, `++a` or `a++`.

The difference between the two is when the increment or decrement is applied. For example, `a++` increments `a` after the current value is used. `++a` increments `a` before the current value is used.

```java
x = 10;
y = ++x; // y is 11, x is 11
```

```java
x = 10;
y = x++; // y is 10, x is 11
```

#### Relational Operators and Logical Operators

The relational operators are:
| Operator | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `==` | Equal to |
| `!=` | Not equal to |
| `>` | Greater than |
| `<` | Less than |
| `>=` | Greater than or equal to |
| `<=` | Less than or equal to |

The logical operators are:
| Operator | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `&` | AND |
| `\|` | OR |
| `^` | XOR (exclusive OR) |
| `\|\|` | Short-circuit OR |
| `&&` | Short-circuit AND |
| `!` | NOT |

The short-circuit operators only evaluate the right-hand side if necessary. For example, in `a && b`, if `a` is `false`, `b` is not evaluated.

In Java, all objects can be compared with the `==` and `!=` operators.

For the logical operators, the operands must be boolean.
