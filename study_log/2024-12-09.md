## Java: A Beginner's Guide - Chapter 1

**From**: Page 28

Check the example program [src/java_a_beginners_guide/ch01/GalToLitTable.java](../src/java_a_beginners_guide/ch01/GalToLitTable.java) to see a program that converts gallons to liters and displays a table of conversions.

### The Java keywords
Java currently has 68 keywords. These keywords are reserved and cannot be used as identifiers.

### Identifiers
An identifier is a name that is used to identify a class, method, variable, or label. An identifier must begin with a letter, dollar sign `$`, or underscore `_`. The subsequent characters can be letters, digits, dollar signs, or underscores. Identifiers are case-sensitive.

### Chapter 1 - Self Test
What is byte code?
- Byte code is the intermediate representation of the source code that is generated by the Java compiler. The byte code is then interpreted by the JVM.

What are three main principles of object-oriented programming?
- Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Where do Java programs begin their execution?
- Java programs begin their execution at the main method.

What is a variable?
- A variable is a named memory location that stores a value.

How do you create a single-line comment?
- A single-line comment is started with `//`.

How do you create a multi-line comment?
- A multi-line comment is started with `/*` and ended with `*/`.

Show the general form of the if statement.
- The general form of the if statement is:
```java
if (condition) statement;
```

Show the general form of the for loop.
- The general form of the for loop is:
```java
for (initialization; condition; iteration) statement;
```

How do you create a block of code?
- A block of code is created by enclosing the statements in curly braces `{}`.

Does it matter where on a line you put a statement?
- No, it does not matter where on a line you put a statement.


## Core Java, Volume I - Chapter 1

Java is not just a programming language, it is a platform, with a large library of classes and interfaces. The Java platform is a combination of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), the Java Application Programming Interface (API), and the Java Language.

### The buzzwords of Java

Java is **simple**. It is simple in the sense that it is easy to learn and use. However, it is also complex in the sense that it is a powerful language with a large library of classes and interfaces.

Java is **object-oriented**. Everything in Java is an object, except for the primitive types.

Java is **distributed**. Java is designed to support distributed computing and to allow objects to communicate over a network.

Java is **robust**. Java is designed to be robust and to handle errors gracefully. Java has a strong type system and automatic garbage collection.

Java is **secure**. Due to protections of the virtual machine, Java is designed to be secure and to protect the user from malicious code.

Java is **architecture-neutral**. Java is designed to be architecture-neutral and to run on any architecture that has a JVM installed.

Java is **portable**. Java is designed to be platform-independent. An int is always 32 bits, regardless of the platform. However when it comes to GUI programming, Java is not as portable as it could be.

Java is **high-performance**. Java is designed to be high performance and to execute code quickly. The JIT compiler is used to improve the performance of Java programs by compiling the byte code into machine code that can be executed by the CPU.

Java is **multithreaded**. Java is designed to support multithreading and to allow multiple threads to run concurrently. Java has built-in support for threads and synchronization.

Java is **dynamic**. Java is designed to be dynamic and to support dynamic loading of classes and interfaces. Java has a reflection API that can be used to inspect and modify classes at runtime.
