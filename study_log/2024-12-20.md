# Notes (Day 15) - Core Java, Volume I  - Chapter 3

## Comments

Single-line comments start with `//` and end at the end of the line. For example:
```java
// This is a single-line comment
```
Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`. For example:
```java
/*
This is a multi-line comment
It can span multiple lines
*/
```
Javadoc comments start with `/**` and end with `*/`. Javadoc comments are used to generate API documentation. For example:
```java
/**
 * This is a Javadoc comment
 */
```

## Data Types


### Integer Types

In Java the size of all the numeric types is fixed and platform-independent. The following table shows the integer types in Java:

| Type | Size | Range (inclusive) |
|------|------|-------------------|
| byte | 8 bits | -128 to 127 |
| short | 16 bits | -32,768 to 32,767 |
| int | 32 bits | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 |
| long | 64 bits | -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 |

### Floating-Point Types

The two floating point types in Java are `float` and `double`.

| Type | Size | Range |
|------|------|-------|
| float | 32 bits | 1.4E-45 to 3.4028235E38 |
| double | 64 bits | 4.9E-324 to 1.7976931348623157E308 |

An E or e suffix means "times ten to the power of". For example, `1.4E-45` means 1.4 times 10 to the power of -45.

Numbers of type float have an `f` or `F` suffix. For example:
```java
float f = 1.337f;
```

Floating-point numbers withouth a suffix are of type double. For example:
```java
double d = 1.337;
```

But you can also use a `d` or `D` suffix:
```java
double d = 1.337d;
```

There are three special floating-point values:
- `+Infinity`
- `-Infinity`
- `NaN` (Not a Number)

```java
jshell> 1.0 / 0
$10 ==> Infinity

jshell> -1.0 / 0
$12 ==> -Infinity

jshell> 0.0 / 0
$13 ==> NaN
```
