### Creating objects

To create an object, you have to call the constructor of the class using the `new` keyword. The `new` keyword creates an object and returns a reference to the object. The reference can be stored in a variable.

```java
Animal myAnimal = new Animal();
```

To create a constructor, you need to create a method with the same name as the class. The constructor does not have a return type specified.

If you do not create a constructor, Java provides a default constructor that takes no arguments

```java
public class Animal {
    public Animal() { // The constructor needs to have the same name as the class
        System.out.println("A new animal is being created!");
        // Constructor code goes here
    }
}
```

However below is not a constructor:
```java
public class Animal {
    public void Animal() { // This is not a constructor
        System.out.println("This is not a constructor");
    }
}
```

#### Reading and writing fields
source: `Swan.java`
```java
public class Swan {
    int numberEggs;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Swan myswan = new Swan();
        myswan.numberEggs = 10;
        System.out.println("I'm having " + myswan.numberEggs + " eggs in my basket.");
    }

}
```

#### Instance initializer blocks
source: `Swan.java`
```java
public class Swan {
    int numberEggs;

    {
        System.out.println("Setting the number of eggs to 10");
        numberEggs = 10;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Swan myswan = new Swan();
        System.out.println("I'm having " + myswan.numberEggs + " eggs in my basket.");
    }

}
```

An instance initializer block is a block of code that is executed when an object is created. The instance initializer block is executed before the constructor. Why would you use an instance initializer block instead of a constructor? You might use an instance initializer block if you have code that you want to run for every constructor.

#### Order of initialization
source: `Swan.java`
```java
public class Swan {
    int numberEggs = 10;

    {
        numberEggs = 20;
    }

    public Swan() {
        numberEggs = 30;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Swan myswan = new Swan();
        System.out.println("I'm having " + myswan.numberEggs + " eggs in my basket.");
    }

}
```

The order of initialization is:
1. Fields and instance initializer blocks are run in the order in which they appear in the file.
2. The constructor runs.

### Understanding Data Types

#### The primitive data types
The eight primitive data types are:
| Type | Description | Default Value | Range |
|------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| boolean | true or false | false | |
| byte | 8-bit integral value | 0 | -128 to 127 |
| short | 16-bit integral value | 0 | -32,768 to 32,767 |
| int | 32-bit integral value | 0 | -2^31 to 2^31-1 |
| long | 64-bit integral value | 0L | -2^63 to 2^63-1 |
| float | 32-bit floating-point value | 0.0f | |
| double | 64-bit floating-point value | 0.0d | |
| char | 16-bit Unicode value | '\u0000' | 0 to 65,535 |

##### short and char
The `short` and `char` types are both 16-bit integral types. The difference is that `short` is signed, while `char` is unsigned. Short and char values can be cast to each other.

```java
short s = 10;
char c = (char) s;
```
