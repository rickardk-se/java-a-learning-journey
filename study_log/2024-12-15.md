### Summary

- Java begins execution with the `main()` method.
  - `public static void main(String[] args)`
- Arguments are indexed starting from 0.
- Java code is organized into folders called packages.
- To include a package in your program, use the `import` statement.
  - The java.lang package is automatically imported.
- Java has eight primitive types.
- Wrapper classes are used to represent primitive types as objects.
- A reference type refers to an object.
- Local variables must be initialized before they are used.
- Local variables may use the `var` keyword to infer the type.
- A variable is declared with a type and an optional initializer.
  - `int x = 10;`
  - `var x = 10; // infers int`
  - `String name = "Fluffy";`
- Scope refers to the visibility of a variable.
  - Instance variables, class variables, and local variables have different scopes.
- Constructors are used to create objects.
    - A constructor has the same name as the class and no return type.
- Methods are used to define behavior.
    - A method has a return type, a name, and a list of parameters.
- Fields are used to store data.
    - Fields are declared with a type and a name.
- Garbage collection is the process of automatically freeing memory.
- A text block is a multi-line string starting and ending with `"""`.
