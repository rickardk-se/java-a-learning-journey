### Relational and Logical Operators
```java
public class RelLogOps {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int i = 10, j = 11;
        boolean b1 = true, b2 = false;

        if (i < j)
            System.out.println("i < j");
        if (i <= j)
            System.out.println("i <= j");
        if (i != j)
            System.out.println("i != j");
        if (i == j)
            System.out.println("i == j"); // this won't execute
        if (i > j)
            System.out.println("i > j"); // this won't execute
        if (i >= j)
            System.out.println("i >= j"); // this won't execute

        if (b1 & b2)
            System.out.println("This won't execute"); // AND
        if (!(b1 & b2))
            System.out.println("!(b1 & b2 ) is " + (!(b1 & b2))); // NOT AND
        if (b1 | b2)
            System.out.println("b1 | b2 is " + (b1 | b2)); // OR
        if (b1 ^ b2)
            System.out.println("b1 ^ b2 is " + (b1 ^ b2)); // XOR

    }
}
```

### Short-Circuit Logical Operators

The short-circuit logical operators are `&&` and `||`. They only evaluate the right-hand side if necessary. This is useful when the right-hand side has a side effect that you want to avoid.

Another name for the short-circuit logical operators is *conditional logical operators*.

### The assignment operator
Chain assignment is possible in Java. For example:
```java
int a,b,c;
a = b = c = 100; // set a, b, and c to 100
```


Short-hand assignment operators are also possible in Java. For example:
```java
int a = 10;
a += 2; // a is now 12
a -= 4; // a is now 8
a *= 3; // a is now 24
a /= 2; // a is now 12
a %= 7; // a is now 5
a &= 3; // a is now 1, bitwise AND
a |= 8; // a is now 9, bitwise OR
a ^= 1; // a is now 8, bitwise XOR 0b1001 ^ 0b0001 = 0b1000
```

The short-hand assignments are also called *compound assignments*.

### Type Conversion in Assignments

When you assign a value of one type to a variable of another type, the value is automatically converted to the type of the variable. This is called *type conversion*.

In order for the conversion to take place, the type of the value being assigned must be compatible with the type of the variable and the destination type must be larger than the source type.

Allowed conversions:
- byte to short, int, long, float, or double
- short to int, long, float, or double
- char to int, long, float, or double
- int to long, float, or double
- long to float or double
- float to double

int to byte for example is a (potential) loss of magnitude because you can't store 500 in a byte.

long to float is a potential loss of precision but not magnitude because the value range for floats is larger than that for longs.

So the rule is:
- Loss of magnitude: explicit cast required.
- Loss of precision: no cast required.
