# Notes (Day 14) - Core Java, Volume I  - Chapter 3

## The main method
The main method is the entry point of a Java program. The main method has the following signature:
```java
public static void main(String[] args)
```
However Java 21 has a preview feature described in JEP 445 that allow you to write the main method as:
```java
class FirstSample {
    void main() {
        System.out.println("We will not use 'String[] args' here");
    }
}
```

```shell
$ javac --release 21 --enable-preview FirstSample.java
$ java --enable-preview FirstSample
We will not use 'String[] args' here
```
