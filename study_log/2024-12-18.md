# Notes (Day 13) - Java: A Beginner's Guide - Chapter 2

## Casting incompatible types
A cast is an explicit type conversion. It is used when you want to convert a value from a wider type to a narrower type. For example, converting a `double` to an `int`.

```java
double d = 100.74;
int i = (int) d; // i is now 100
```

Remember that information can be lost when casting. For example, when casting a `double` to an `int`, the fractional part is truncated.

## Operator Precedence
1. Parentheses `(), [], {}`
2. Postfix `x++, x--`
3. Prefix `++x, --x`
4. Unary `+, -, !`
5. Multiplication, Division, Modulus `*, /, %`
6. Addition, Subtraction `+, -`
7. Shift `<<, >>, >>>`
8. Relational `>, <, >=, <=, instanceof`
9. Equality `==, !=`
10. Bitwise AND `&`
11. Bitwise XOR `^`
12. Bitwise OR `|`
13. Logical AND `&&`
14. Logical OR `||`
15. Conditional `?:`
16. Assignment `=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &=, ^=, |=, <<=, >>=, >>>=`

## Expressions
When you combine variables, literals, method return values, and operators, you get an expression. An expression is a construct that evaluates to a single value.

All char, short, and byte values are promoted to `int` before being used in an expression. If one of the operands is a `long`, `float`, or `double`, the other is converted to that type.

```java
jshell> byte a = 10, b = 5;
a ==> 10
b ==> 5

jshell> byte c = a * b;
|  Error:
|  incompatible types: possible lossy conversion from int to byte
|  byte c = a * b;
|           ^---^
```
Instead you have to cast the result to a `byte`:
```java
jshell> byte c = (byte) (a * b);
c ==> 50
```

## Spacing and Parentheses
These two expressions are the same but the second one is easier to read:
```java
int x=10/y*(127/x);
int x = 10 / y * (127 / x);
```

Use redundant parentheses to make the code easier to read:
```java
int x = (10 / y) * (127 / x);
```
